pyage
=====
Pyage is an agent-based computing and simulation platform built with the use of Python technology. Computations might be performed on a single machine or in accordance with the distributed computing model. The platform is composed of loosely coupled components, therefore its functionality may be freely extended by providing own implementations of the given components. Moreover, these parts of the platform might be easily replaced during runtime.
